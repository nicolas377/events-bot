  "description": "This project is probably one of the largest undertakings I've gone through. This is my first Discord bot, and I'm very proud of it. I'm hosting it [on replit.com](https://replit.com/@nrod06/events-bot?v=1). All the code on this repository is exactly what's being used on the repl. The only difference is that the encryption key and bot token are in a hidden file.",
