			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/nrod_06" class="nicolas">Nicolas</a>, and I'm the developer behind the Events bot.</p>

		<p>Events Bot was my first node.js adventure, and it was quite an adventure. I'm hosting the bot on <a href="https://replit.com/@nrod06/events-bot?v=1" target="_blank" class="replit">replit.com.</a> The bot has had many updates, and it's open source as well <a href="https://github.com/nicolas377/events-bot" class="replit" target="_blank">on github</a>. I used the discord.js library to interact with the Discord API. This was made in the middle of my freshman year of high school.</p>
		<h3>Core Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Pictures - Staff members would add pictures of events, and those pictures would be used in certain bot commands.</li>
			<li>User Info - Fairly self explanatory.</li>
			<li>Elections - In GeoFS Events, when elections were run, they were run using the code system from the bot along with Google Forms.</li>
			<li>Timezones - Users could give the bot their GMT offset, and the bot would put it on display for easier scheduling of events.</li>
			<li>Moderation - Mods could approve users out of the waiting room when they join and send users to the questioning room for being naughty.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What happened</h3>
		<p>I left the GeoFS Events server permanently. As a result of that, the bot was kicked from the server by a mod. <sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Citation" target="_blank">citation needed</a>]</sup> I'm working on an explanation of what happened, and I'll post that here when it's done.</p>
