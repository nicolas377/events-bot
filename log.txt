1619295857415: Events Bot: 1. This must look weird to have a bot talking to you

1619302776050: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: Because I probably won't be there,,,,
1619302776457: Featherway: O
1619302778875: Featherway: Yea
1619302779565: ThePickle: AAAA alr
1619302785490: App server is running.
1619302786040: Ready to work!
1619302786128: Events Bot: ```js
client.channels.cache.get('760831152109649940').send(message)
```
1619302788262: ThePickle: Wait no 8:45 your time
1619302792224: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: <@780458120605990954> o
1619302795872: Featherway: That's gud
1619302797587: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: Is there a easier way tho
1619302833965: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: https://tenor.com/view/roblox-gif-21277679
1619302856761: Events Bot: you have to get the channel, then call the send() method to send a message
1619303360778: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: O
1619303702435: Events Bot: like i said before, i'll explain everything when i get back on my actual account and out of this stupid js console
1619304221024: Featherway: Also imma make the rules in <#717781781981560892>  so that servers can only be posted by their owners. That will avoid all those scam servers and ||someone posting a GPC invite there||
1619305185940: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: .
1619361944668: App server is running.
1619361945133: Ready to work!
1619364623430: Featherway: Imma pass this idea around. Do you think we should get a new upcoming events channel that we post events in for the next day, but delete the events after they end. That might help with having multiple events per day.
1619365052201: Featherway: But I also like what we have now...so yea
1619366555592: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: Sup

1619366617861: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: <@338699055943254030> how are applications going
1619366623066: ᴛʜʏ ᴘᴏɢɢᴜꜱ ɴᴀᴠɪɢᴀᴛᴏʀ: Km gonna read some of them
1619367033428: Featherway: ...
1619367046277: Featherway: So much better
