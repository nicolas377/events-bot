# GeoFS Events Bot

This project is probably one of the largest undertakings I've gone through. This is my first Discord bot, and I'm very proud of it. I'm hosting it [on replit.com](https://replit.com/@nrod06/events-bot?v=1). All the code on this repository is exactly what's being used on the repl. The only difference is that the encryption key and bot token are in a hidden file.

I am extremely proud of how this project has gone so far, and I'm excited for its future. According to the Github API, I've written [over 39000 lines of code](https://api.github.com/repos/nicolas377/events-bot/languages) in 48 days.
