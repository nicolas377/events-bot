# GeoFS Events Bot

This project is probably one of the largest undertakings I've gone through. This is my first Discord bot, and I'm very proud of it. I'm hosting it [on repl.it](https://replit.com/@nrod06/events-bot?v=1). All the code on this repository is exactly what's being used on the repl. The only difference is that the encryption key and bot token are in a hidden file.

I am extremely proud of how this project has gone so far, and I'm excited for its future. As of now, over a thousand lines of code have been written in the span of 18 days.
