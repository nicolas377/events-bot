# GeoFS Events Bot

This project is probably one of the largest undertakings I've gone through. This is my first Discord bot, and I'm very proud of it. I'm hosting it [on replit.com](https://replit.com/@nrod06/events-bot?v=1). All the code on this repository is exactly what's being used on the repl. The only difference is that the encryption key and bot token are in a hidden file.

The project ended after I left the GeoFS Events server and the bot was kicked from the server. See [here](https://events-bot.nrod06.repl.co/about) for more details.

I'm extremely proud of how this project went. According to the Github API, I wrote [over 38000 lines of code](https://api.github.com/repos/nicolas377/events-bot/languages) in 67 days.
